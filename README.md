“Leo Spare Parts” is an accepted and growing auto spare parts business in Sri Lanka. Their company is based on supplying high quality auto spare parts to their customers. Their business act as an intermediate between a buyer and a seller simply a B2C system. Due to the current pandemic situation and the increasing of customers the company has taught of building up an automated web system by which they can gain many benefits to the company as well as they can supply the best service to the customers.
So, to cope up with this situation our team has come with an idea to build up a website which would focus all the important and necessary requirements of both the customer and the company, so we divided four main functions, they are
1.Customer Manager (client side)
2.Product Manager (Admin)
3.Delivery Manager 
4.Forum Handling 
are the functions that are mainly focused through the proposed system.
